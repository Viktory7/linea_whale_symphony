# Linea Whale Symphony 🎻🎺

Not your average whale tracker.

This isn’t beeping and barking like every other script.  
This is **classical music**.

Every time a whale moves **$1M+** on Linea, the orchestra plays.  
You don’t get alerts — you get a **live performance**.

- $2M transfer? → A gentle violin solo  
- $50M whale? → Full brass section, cymbals crashing  
- Insider dumping the treasury? → Wagner-level drama  

No emojis. No "LFG". Just pure, refined chaos in terminal form.
